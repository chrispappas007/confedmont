He came from Jones County, Georgia and established his residence at what is still called “The Old Feagin Place.” Samuel purchased a large acreage of land and sold it to incoming settlers. He built a log cabin with rooms above where travelers were accommodated overnight. It was also used as a stagecoach stop for those traveling from Eufaula to Tuskegee. On July 11, 1813 the Midway Post Office was established and Samuel Feagin was the first postmaster. On February 23, 1870, the town of Midway was incorporated. The business part of Midway was originally built around a square. A fire destroyed most of this area. The settlers rebuilt their businesses and continued to grow and thrive with eight dry goods and grocery stores, two houses of entertainment, one livery, and a large manufacturing establishment for carriages and buggies. The lower section of Midway, at the Central of Georgia Railroad, was once called James, Alabama. On March 18, 1903, the Union Springs Herald stated the Town of Midway and James had grown not only in population but businesses that included a drugstore, cotton ginnery, dry goods, post office, Midway and James Bank, train station, funeral home, barber shop and town hall. A granite boulder, located was erected to commemorates the Jefferson Davis Highway and Soldiers of the Confederacy. Midway has several sites listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage, with one listed on the National Register of Historic Places.","latitude":32.070202,"longitude":-85.5242296}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.380162,32.513817]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":58,"field_1":"","uid":"21","feature_name":"Robinson Springs Camp Confederate Monument","address":"5899 Main Street And Monument Drive","city":"Millbrook","state":"AL","side":"South","category":"Monument","group_class":"Monument","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"1913","school_percent_black":"","source":"http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=83692","notes":"","latitude":32.5138166,"longitude":-86.3801621}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.064809,30.682866]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":59,"field_1":"","uid":"22","feature_name":"10\" Rifled Sea Coast Columbiad","address":"65 Government Street","city":"Mobile","state":"AL","side":"South","category":"Monument","group_class":"Monument","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"2004","school_percent_black":"","source":"http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=86727","notes":"","latitude":30.682866,"longitude":-88.064809}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.064809,30.682866]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":60,"field_1":"","uid":"23","feature_name":"Admiral Raphael Semmes Statue","address":"65 Government Street","city":"Mobile","state":"AL","side":"South","category":"Monument","group_class":"Monument","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"2000","school_percent_black":"","source":"http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc16/mobile1.htm; http://www.americanmemorialsdirectory.com/alabama.html","notes":"","latitude":30.682866,"longitude":-88.064809}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.30484,32.377543]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":61,"field_1":"","uid":"24","feature_name":"Dexter Avenue Monument","address":"Dexter Ave.","city":"Montgomery","state":"AL","side":"South","category":"Monument","group_class":"Monument","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"1942","school_percent_black":"","source":"http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6H9","notes":"Dexter Avenue\nFormerly Market Street\nThis street was named to honor Andrew Dexter one of the founders of Montgomery\nAlong this street moved the inaugural parade of Jefferson Davis when he took the oath of office as President of the Confederate States of America February 18, 1861\nDixie was played as a band arrangement for the first time on this occasion.\nPlaced by by Sophie Bibb Chapter, U.D.C.","latitude":32.3775427,"longitude":-86.3048402}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.299969,32.366805]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":62,"field_1":"","uid":"25","feature_name":"Robert E.

Soon the Confederacy found it necessary, however, to adopt an appropriate \"national\" flag. The first was the famous Stars and Bars. During the Battle of Bull Run it was found that this Confederate Banner looked too much like the Stars and Stripes. After some experimentation, the Battle Flag, or Southern Cross, became the best known and generally recognized symbol of the South until April 9, 1865 when the war was over. Lincoln's prophecy on the divided nation had come true. \"I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\" On April 14, 1865, the Stars and Stripes were ceremoniously raised once again over the South. Ironically, the event commanded little public press, for a few hours later Abraham Lincoln was assassinated as he sat in the President' s box at the Ford['s] Theater in Washington.","latitude":37.6871761,"longitude":-97.330053}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.619518,39.053404]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":427,"field_1":"o","uid":"","feature_name":"General Ross Drive","address":"","city":"Erlanger","state":"KY","side":"Border","category":"Road / Street / Highway","group_class":"Highway / Roadway","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"","school_percent_black":"","source":"","notes":"","latitude":39.0534036,"longitude":-84.6195178}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.297912,36.843943]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":428,"field_1":"o","uid":"","feature_name":"Jefferson Davis Road","address":"","city":"Elkton","state":"KY","side":"Border","category":"Road / Street / Highway","group_class":"Highway / Roadway","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"","school_percent_black":"","source":"","notes":"","latitude":36.843943,"longitude":-87.2979118}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.22372,36.827317]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":429,"field_1":"o","uid":"","feature_name":"Jefferson Davis Highway","address":"","city":"Elkton","state":"KY","side":"Border","category":"Road / Street / Highway","group_class":"Highway / Roadway","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"","school_percent_black":"","source":"","notes":"","latitude":36.8273166,"longitude":-87.2237202}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.521095,37.31742]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":430,"field_1":"o","uid":"","feature_name":"Jefferson Davis Drive","address":"","city":"Madisonville","state":"KY","side":"Border","category":"Road / Street / Highway","group_class":"Highway / Roadway","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"","school_percent_black":"","source":"","notes":"","latitude":37.3174199,"longitude":-87.5210949}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.598763,36.692083]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":431,"field_1":"o","uid":"","feature_name":"Jeff Davis Road","address":"","city":"Mayfield","state":"KY","side":"Border","category":"Road / Street / Highway","group_class":"Highway / Roadway","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"","school_percent_black":"","source":"","notes":"","latitude":36.6920829,"longitude":-88.5987626}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.431836,37.542206]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":432,"field_1":"o","uid":"","feature_name":"Robert Lee Road","address":"","city":"Raywick","state":"KY","side":"Border","category":"Road / Street / Highway","group_class":"Highway / Roadway","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"","school_percent_black":"","source":"","notes":"","latitude":37.5422056,"longitude":-85.4318361}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.873283,38.200905]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":433,"field_1":"","uid":"1","feature_name":"Robert E Lee Day","address":"","city":"Frankfort","state":"KY","side":"South","category":"Holiday","group_class":"Holiday / Observances","secondary_class_for_internal_use":"","year_dedicated":"19-Jan","school_percent_black":"","source":"http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=46","notes":"Occurs on Jan 19.

During the Civil War, a skirmish was fought here between Union and Confederate troops on 7 July 1863.
